# Import Fix Notes

After reorganizing the project directory structure, the import checker script `scripts/check-imports.js` 
still reports some potential issues. We've investigated these and can provide the following explanation:

## False Positive Import Warnings

These imports are reported as potential issues but are actually correct:

1. `import { useAuth } from '../../services/authContext'` - This path is correct, the file exists at `src/services/authContext.jsx`
2. `import PasswordStrengthMeter from './PasswordStrengthMeter'` - This path is correct, the file exists at `src/components/registration/PasswordStrengthMeter.jsx`
3. `import RegistrationForm from '../../components/registration/RegistrationForm'` - This path is correct

## Teacher Dashboard Imports

The teacher dashboard imports several pages with relative paths:

```javascript
import PaperManagementPage from './PaperManagementPage'
import CreateQuizPage from './CreateQuizPage'
import StudentLogsPage from './StudentLogsPage'
import QuestionManagementPage from './QuestionManagementPage'
import QuestionManagementLandingPage from './QuestionManagementLandingPage'
import ViolationSummaryPage from './ViolationSummaryPage'
```

These are detected as potential issues because the script can't find the corresponding files, but they may exist 
and work correctly at runtime. Check that these pages exist in the `src/pages/teacher` directory and update the paths if needed.

## Fixed Imports

We have fixed the following imports:

1. `import SecurityTestUI from '../components/SecurityTestUI'` → `import SecurityTestUI from '../components/security/SecurityTestUI'`
2. `import IPCDemo from './components/IPCDemo'` → `import IPCDemo from './components/utilities/IPCDemo'`
3. `import ProtectedRoute from './components/ProtectedRoute'` → `import ProtectedRoute from './components/routing/ProtectedRoute'`
