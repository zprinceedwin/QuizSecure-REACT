# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Platform Compatibility (Prototype)

This QuizSecure Electron application is a prototype developed for thesis purposes. 

- **Primary Development OS:** Windows
- **Testing:** Primarily tested on Windows.

While Electron is a cross-platform framework, comprehensive testing, specific optimizations, and verification of all features on macOS and Linux have not been performed for this prototype stage. Functionality on these platforms is not guaranteed.
