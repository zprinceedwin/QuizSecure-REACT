# Face Detection Implementation

## Overview

This document provides information about the face detection implementation in QuizSecure, focusing on performance metrics, optimization strategies, and configuration options.

## Performance Baseline

The face detection system uses MediaPipe Face Mesh for detecting and tracking faces in real-time. Our baseline performance assessment tool measures:

1. **Processing Speed:**
   - Frames Per Second (FPS)
   - Average processing time per frame (ms)
   - Min/Max/Median processing times

2. **Detection Quality:**
   - Face detection rate (% of frames with successful detection)
   - Average confidence score
   - Detection gaps (Face lost between frames)
   - Estimated false positives/negatives

## Benchmark Results

| Environment | FPS (Avg) | Processing Time (Avg) | Detection Rate | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|----------------|-------|
| Optimal Lighting | 22-28 | 35-45ms | 95-99% | Best performance with frontal face |
| Low Light | 20-25 | 40-50ms | 85-92% | Degraded confidence scores |
| Backlit | 18-22 | 45-55ms | 75-85% | Higher false negatives |
| Side Angle | 15-20 | 50-60ms | 70-80% | Detection gaps increase |

*Note: Results vary based on hardware and browser capabilities. Conducted on Intel i5 with 8GB RAM.*

## MediaPipe Configuration Options

The face detection system can be fine-tuned with the following parameters:

- **maxFaces**: Number of faces to detect (1-4)
- **refineLandmarks**: Enable/disable refined landmarks detection
- **minDetectionConfidence**: Minimum confidence for a face detection to be considered successful (0.1-0.9)
- **minTrackingConfidence**: Minimum confidence to track face between frames (0.1-0.9)

### Performance Impact of Configuration Changes

| Configuration Change | Impact on FPS | Impact on Detection Rate |
|----------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Increase maxFaces | -15% to -30% per additional face | No significant change |
| Enable refineLandmarks | -10% to -15% | +5% to +10% accuracy |
| Increase minDetectionConfidence | +5% to +10% | -5% to -15% |
| Increase minTrackingConfidence | +3% to +8% | -3% to -10% |

## Optimization Strategies

Based on our performance assessment, the following optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Dynamic Configuration Adjustment:**
   - Automatically adjust parameters based on detected performance
   - Lower refineLandmarks and detection count in low-performance environments

2. **Frame Processing Optimization:**
   - Skip frames when processing time exceeds thresholds
   - Prioritize tracking over detection when possible

3. **Context-Aware Processing:**
   - Different settings for initialization vs. continuous monitoring
   - Reduced processing during quiz content display

4. **Hardware Acceleration:**
   - Utilize WebGL when available
   - Electron-specific optimizations for desktop performance

## Benchmarking Tool

A benchmarking tool is available at `/face-detection-benchmark` that allows:

- Testing different environments and configurations
- Measuring real-time performance metrics
- Comparing results across different settings
- Saving benchmark results for later analysis

This tool should be used when:
- Diagnosing performance issues
- Testing on new hardware configurations
- Evaluating the impact of code changes
- Calibrating detection parameters
