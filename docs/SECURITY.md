# QuizSecure Electron Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the QuizSecure Electron application to protect against common security vulnerabilities.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)

A Content Security Policy has been implemented to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other code injection attacks.

```javascript
"default-src 'self';",
"script-src 'self';",
"img-src 'self' data:;",
"style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';",
"font-src 'self';",
"connect-src 'self';",
"media-src 'self' mediastream:;",
"object-src 'none';",
"child-src 'none';",
"frame-src 'none';",
"base-uri 'self';",
"form-action 'self';",
"frame-ancestors 'none';",
"upgrade-insecure-requests;"
```

### 2. Secure Web Preferences

The Electron BrowserWindow is created with secure webPreferences:

```javascript
webPreferences: {
  nodeIntegration: false,
  contextIsolation: true,
  sandbox: true,
  preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
  webSecurity: true,
  allowRunningInsecureContent: false,
  experimentalFeatures: false
}
```

### 3. Context Isolation

Context isolation is enabled to prevent access to the Node.js API from the renderer process. A secure preload script is used to expose only specific, vetted functions via the contextBridge.

### 4. Permission Management

The application implements strict permission control to only allow access to necessary features:

```javascript
const allowedPermissions = [
  'media', // Webcam/microphone access
  'notifications'
];
```

All other permission requests are automatically denied.

### 5. Secure IPC Communication

Secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) has been implemented with:

- Explicit channel whitelisting for all IPC communications
- Limited exposure of main process functionality
- Sanitization of data passed between main and renderer processes

### 6. Navigation Control

The application prevents navigation to untrusted origins:

- Navigation is only allowed to specific trusted URLs
- External links are opened in the default browser, not in the application
- New windows and popups are prevented

### 7. Insecure Content Blocking

HTTP requests are blocked when the app is running in production, allowing only secure HTTPS requests.

### 8. Remote Module Disabled

The deprecated Remote module is explicitly disabled to prevent potential security issues.

## Security Best Practices

When developing new features for the QuizSecure application, follow these security best practices:

1. **Do not enable nodeIntegration**: This could give renderer processes complete access to Node.js
2. **Always use contextIsolation with a preload script**: Maintain separation between Electron/Node.js and renderer content
3. **Whitelist communication channels**: Add new IPC channels to the appropriate whitelist in preload.js
4. **Validate all input**: Never trust user input or data from renderer processes
5. **Limit permissions**: Only request necessary permissions for application functionality
6. **Use secure connections**: Always use HTTPS for API calls and content loading
7. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update Electron and all dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
